SECURE-SYSTEM-CALL
User Friendly Secure System Call Project Report

Project Overview The "User Friendly Secure System Call" project aims to create a secure and intuitive interface for users to perform system calls without requiring deep technical knowledge. The application will allow users to execute various system calls, such as file operations and process management, while ensuring that security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access and vulnerabilities. The expected outcome is a functional desktop application that enhances user experience and security.
Module-Wise Breakdown Module 1: User Interface (UI) • Purpose: To provide a graphical interface for users to interact with the system. • Roles: • Display available system calls and their descriptions. • Provide input fields for parameters required by the system calls. • Show results and error messages clearly. Module 2: Security Layer • Purpose: To ensure secure execution of system calls and validate user inputs. • Roles: • Implement user authentication (e.g., username/password). • Validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks. • Log all system calls and user actions for auditing. Module 3: System Call Handler • Purpose: To manage the execution of system calls and return results to the UI. • Roles: • Execute system calls based on user input. • Handle errors and exceptions gracefully. • Return results to the UI for display.
Functionalities Module 1: User Interface (UI) • System Call Selection: Users can select from a list of available system calls (e.g., "Create File," "Delete File"). • Dynamic Input Fields: Input fields change based on the selected system call. • Result Display: Show success or error messages after executing a system call. Module 2: Security Layer • User Authentication: Secure login mechanism to restrict access. • Input Validation: Check for valid input formats to prevent injection attacks. • Audit Logging: Maintain logs of all actions for security audits. Module 3: System Call Handler • Execution of System Calls: Safely execute system calls based on user input. • Error Handling: Provide meaningful error messages for failed system calls. • Result Processing: Format and return results to the UI.
Technology Used Programming Languages: • Python or Java Libraries and Tools: • UI Module: Tkinter (Python) or JavaFX (Java) • Security Module: Flask-Security (Python) or Spring Security (Java) • System Call Module: os and subprocess libraries in Python Other Tools: • GitHub for version control • PyCharm (Python) or IntelliJ IDEA (Java) for development • PyTest (Python) or JUnit (Java) for testing
